# Trash_Dummy
the speedy way to crumple up. Clear Trash from VS code.

Click == Crash. 

terminal -> menubar -> vscode -> run expression || drag mouse -> click trash can -> click remove


Thought of a [dumpsterdiving|digintrash] aspect of app. The expression as this app was imagined the other day would've deleted all the items in the trash.
Now, userinput will gather specification of: whether all trash items will be deleted or whether some will remain.

This will be facilitated by regex.
myexamplefile_y.txt || hikingphoto_y.jpg

_y     if this is possible in C, I want to run a regex expression that will parse for a last character underscore and a consecutive 'y' string char.
Upon encountering these characters, the expression will [lock_&_key] and keep the files safe from deletion.
