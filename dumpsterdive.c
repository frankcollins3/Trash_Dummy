 Preliminary input that allows a user to look into the trash for anything they might want before removing The items.
 As I type this it woudl be interesting to tag files. Possibly with (i.e.)
 mynotes.txt
 
 mynotes_y.txt 
 mark files with a regex-friendly _y to parse for characters after underscore. If such a file exists. You can't automatically remove it by clicking clear r
 refuse bin.
   
  
  The bin will refuse to toss out those files.
  
ðŸ“– considering the use this file to port over the items that wont be deleted from the trash.
